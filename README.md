# Mend

**See what [`chant audit`](https://intentius.io/chant/cli/audit/) finds in a
repo's infrastructure — then see what an agent does with it once you hand it
the tool.**

chant is a type system for operations, and `chant audit` is the part of it you
can point at any repo today. It reads the CI workflows, Kubernetes manifests,
Dockerfiles, Helm charts, CloudFormation, ARM and Config Connector templates it
finds, runs a few hundred security and correctness checks over them, and — the
part that matters — sorts what it finds by *how confident the fix is*:

| tier | chant's position |
|---|---|
| **quick win** (merge-worthy, deterministic) | it knows the exact fix and ships the unified diff |
| **needs review** (merge-worthy, guidance) | it is confident something is wrong, and will not guess at the fix |
| **hygiene** (report-only) | worth knowing, not worth a PR |

Most tools stop at a list. That middle tier is why this app exists: it is
precisely the work that needs judgement and a real machine — read the file,
understand what the job is for, decide whether the change preserves behaviour.
So Mend gives chant to an agent (Claude, on a computer of its own) and lets it
finish the job: it applies the mechanical fixes, reasons through the judgement
calls, refuses the ones that turn on intent it cannot see, verifies by
re-running the audit, and hands back one reviewable patch — or opens the pull
request from your browser.

The report shows **all ten** of chant's rule catalogs, not just the ones that
fired — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Forgejo, Kubernetes (with Argo CD and Flux),
Docker, CloudFormation, Azure ARM, Google Cloud, Helm and Fountain. Ten catalogs
ran; the ones with nothing to say are shown greyed rather than hidden, because
"chant read your Helm charts and they were fine" is a result too.

Nothing here is hosted magic. The audit is the same CLI you can run yourself:

```sh
npx -p @intentius/chant -p @intentius/chant-lexicon-github …  chant audit .
```

The same engine runs hosted at [blacklight](https://blacklight.intentius.io).
This page is the version with an agent attached.

**Where Fountain comes in:** the agent needs a real computer — a shell, git, and
chant on the PATH — and something has to hand the browser a stream of what it is
doing. That is [Fountain](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain), and that is
all it is here: the stagehand. Mend is a static page with no backend of its own;
it talks to the Fountain API for the sandbox and to api.github.com for the pull
request. Client patterns (OAuth, SSE, API client) follow
[repo-sage](https://github.com/managoat/repo-sage) /
[dns-desk](https://github.com/managoat/dns-desk).

## Run it

```bash
bun install
bun run dev        # http://localhost:5180
```

On first load, enter your Fountain URL and **Sign in with Fountain** (OAuth
code + PKCE; the token is an API key), or paste an API key. Then name a repo —
`owner/name`, or a URL on `github.com`, `gitlab.com` or `codeberg.org` —
public, or private with a read token (see below). The app hires one mender per
repo (an agent named
`Mend: host/owner/name`, added to your team), sends it off to audit, and
remembers the pairing per Fountain URL in this browser.

Server-side requirements, same as any external Fountain client:

```
API_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5180     # or wherever you host the build

# only for "Sign in with Fountain" — JSON, redirect URIs match exactly:
OAUTH_CLIENTS='[{"id":"mend","name":"Mend","redirect_uris":["http://localhost:5180/"]}]'
```

The production deployment at `mend.demo.managoat.com` needs the same two entries
with `https://mend.demo.managoat.com` / `https://mend.demo.managoat.com/`.

## The toolkit environment

The first time you add a repo, the app creates one Fountain **Environment**
called `Mend toolkit` (`src/lib/spec.ts`) and every mender is created on it:
`npm` packages `@intentius/chant` plus the ten audit lexicons blacklight runs
(GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, k8s, Docker, AWS, Azure, GCP, Helm, Fountain), and
`apt` `jq`. That is what puts `chant audit` on the sandbox's PATH. If the
environment cannot be created the mender still works — the prompt falls back to
an `npx -p …` invocation of the same packages.

Nothing else belongs in that environment — in particular **no GitHub token**.
A credential shared by every mender is exactly what you do not want; the two
tokens Mend can use are both narrower than that, and neither lives here:

| credential | where it lives | what it is for | wants |
|---|---|---|---|
| a repo's clone token | a **vault**, bound to that one repo's mender | cloning a private repository | **read**, that repo only |
| your GitHub token | your browser (`mend.github`) | opening the pull request, as you | **write** (`repo`) |

They are deliberately separate and never fall back to each other, because they
want opposite things. The clone token is held by an agent that reads untrusted
repository content, so it should be read-only; the pull-request token has to be
able to write, so it stays in your browser and never reaches the sandbox.

The app will offer to reuse your connected pull-request token as the clone token
— one paste instead of two — and tells you what you are trading when you accept:
an agent reading untrusted files ends up holding push rights. A read-only token
scoped to the one repository is the better answer if you can be bothered to mint
one.

## Private repositories

Tick *"private repository? add a read token"* when adding a repo and Mend puts
that token in a Fountain **vault** named after the repo, then attaches the vault
to that mender's conversation — Fountain merges vault values over environment
ones, and a vault binds to a single conversation. So the credential's blast
radius is one repository and one agent.

That boundary is the point rather than tidiness: the mender reads untrusted
repository content while holding the token, so **scope it to that repository
only**. It needs read access and nothing more — the mender never pushes.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **A vault can only be bound when the teammate is created.** Attaching a token
  to a repo you have already added rebuilds the mender, which starts a fresh
  thread; the old conversation is kept in Fountain but leaves the view. The app
  says so before it does it.
- **The pull request is a separate credential.** It is opened from your browser
  with your own token, so for a private repo that token needs access too —
  `repo` scope rather than `public_repo`.

## How it works: the mend protocol

The app and the agent share five fenced blocks, parsed out of the agent's
replies (`src/lib/protocol.ts`; the agent's side of the contract is
`src/lib/spec.ts` — change one, change both).

On its first message the mender clones the repo and runs the audit twice (JSON
for structure, Markdown because that is where chant renders the ready-to-apply
quick-win diffs). It reports the audit:

    ```audit-report
    {"branch":"main","commit":"9f1c4a2…","scanned":14,
     "summary":{"total":9,"quickWin":3,"needsReview":4,"reportOnly":2,…},
     "findings":[{"checkId":"GHA033","severity":"error","file":".github/workflows/ci.yml",
                  "entity":"build","tier":"merge-worthy","fixKind":"deterministic",
                  "category":"security","title":"Blanket write-all permissions",
                  "remediation":"Set a least-privilege permissions block.",
                  "authority":{"name":"OSSF Scorecard — Token-Permissions","url":"…"}}],
     "omitted":0}
    ```

The app renders that the way a chant report reads: tier counts, quick wins
grouped by file, guidance clustered under the standard it cites, hygiene folded
away. Every rule id links to its entry in the
[audit rules reference](https://intentius.io/chant/lint-rules/audit-rules/);
every file links into the repo on its host.

Then you press **Mend it**, and the agent works on a branch in its clone and
comes back with a plan and a patch:

    ```mend-plan
    {"before":{"mergeWorthy":7},"after":{"mergeWorthy":1},
     "fixes":[{"id":1,"status":"applied","checkIds":["GHA033"],
               "files":[".github/workflows/ci.yml"],
               "title":"Least-privilege workflow permissions",
               "note":"The build only reads the repo, so contents: read."}],
     "pr":{"title":"ci: harden config per chant audit","body":"…"}}
    ```

    ```mend-patch
    diff --git a/.github/workflows/ci.yml b/.github/workflows/ci.yml
    …
    ```

Fixes are grouped by what *you* have to do about them, which is the honest axis:

| status | means |
|---|---|
| `applied` | a mechanical fix from chant's own diff — read it if you like |
| `proposed` | the agent's judgement call, made because it was confident — review before merging |
| `skipped` | the right answer depends on intent the agent cannot see, with a note on what to decide |

Alongside the plan the mender sends **one `mend-fix <id>` block per fix**,
each carrying only that fix's diff and applying on its own against the
audited commit. That is what makes the fixes independently selectable — the app can
build a commit from exactly the ones you tick.

The patch renders as a diff per file and downloads as a `.patch` you apply
yourself (`git apply mend-owner-name.patch`). Ask for changes in the composer
("drop fix 3", "only the security ones", "split this per finding") and it
revises the working tree and re-emits the blocks; the app shows the newest set.

## Opening a pull request

The agent never opens PRs and never pushes. The app does it, in the browser:

1. **Tick the fixes** you want. Every applied/proposed fix has an *add to PR*
   box; skipped ones cannot be ticked (nothing was changed for them).
2. **Connect GitHub** with your own personal access token (`public_repo`
   scope, or `repo` for a private repository), stored in this browser under `mend.github`. It is deliberately not a
   shared token — Mend is a public page, so anything the app could read, every
   visitor could read. The PR is authored by you, from a credential you revoke.
3. **Draft the description.** The app asks the mender to write a title and body
   for *exactly* the ticked fixes; it comes back as a `pr-draft` block and lands
   in an editable form.
4. **Open pull request.** The app merges the selected fixes' diffs, reads each
   file from GitHub at the current head, applies the hunks, and creates blobs, a
   tree, a commit, a branch and the PR — forking first when you lack push
   access. `api.github.com` allows this from a page, so no backend is involved.

Every context and deletion line is verified against the file as it is on GitHub
*right now*. If the branch moved since the audit, the app refuses and tells you
to re-audit rather than committing a file it cannot vouch for. Opening a PR is
GitHub-only; on GitLab and Codeberg you get the patch.

The conversation is the system of record: the report, the plan and the patch
are all derived from turns + blocks on load, and from one `/api/team/stream`
SSE connection while live. The clone and the branch persist on the mender's
computer between messages.

## Development

```bash
bun test           # protocol, hosts, diff parsing + application, ACP blocks, SSE, render smoke
bun run typecheck
bun run build      # tsc + vite
```

To work on the UI without a live Fountain, run the mock (`bun run mock`), start
the app through the dev proxy (`FOUNTAIN_PROXY=http://localhost:8789 bun run
dev`), and enter `http://localhost:5180` as the Fountain URL with any string as
the API key — you land on a mender that has already audited a repo, mended it
and drafted a PR, with a full report, per-fix diffs, patch and draft form.

No state outside the browser: settings in `localStorage` (`mend.settings`), the
repo → mender pairings per Fountain URL (`mend.repos`), and your GitHub token
(`mend.github`). Nothing is stored on a server.

## Deploy

Static files behind nginx, same as the other demos: CI builds the bundle, bakes
`ghcr.io/managoat/mend`, pins the sha tag into `k8s/deployment.yaml`, and Flux
rolls it out (home-cloud) at `mend.demo.managoat.com`.
