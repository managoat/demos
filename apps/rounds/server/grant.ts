/**
 * Grants: the credential an unattended agent carries.
 *
 * A rounds-style agent has no person present to sign in, so it needs
 * something durable. Handing it a GitHub token would mean a standing
 * credential sitting in a vault; instead it carries a **grant** — a signed
 * statement that "<login> authorized work on <repo>" — and trades it for a
 * one-hour installation token each time it runs.
 *
 * Deliberately stateless: the grant is HMAC-signed rather than stored, so
 * this process keeps no database. Revocation is not lost by that choice, it
 * just lives where it belongs — uninstall the App, or drop the repo from the
 * installation, and the mint fails at GitHub. That is the revocation people
 * actually expect, and it cannot drift out of sync with a table of our own.
